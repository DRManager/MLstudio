## **Overview**

The ML Studio is an interactive platform for data visualization, statistical modeling and machine learning applications. Based on [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) and [shinydashboard](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/) interface, with [Plotly](https://plot.ly/r/) interactive data visualization, [DT](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/) HTML tables and [H2O](https://www.h2o.ai/) machine learning and deep learning algorithms, the ML Studio provides a set of tools for the data science pipeline workflow.
 
## **Installation**

The package is available for installation with the devtools package (if devetools package is not installed please use `install.packages("devtools")` to install it).

```r
# Install the MLstudio
devtools::install_github("RamiKrispin/MLstudio")
```
Please note – the H2O package may require additional Java adds-in (if not installed) and therefor is listed under the “Suggests” packages list of the MLstudio package (and not under the Imports or Depends list) and won’t be installed automatically during the installation of the MLstudio package. More information about the installation of H2O can be find in [H2O documentation](http://h2o-release.s3.amazonaws.com/h2o/rel-weierstrass/7/index.html) (under the "INSTALL IN R" tab).

## **Getting Start**
### **Launch the App**
The app is called from R and opened on the default web browser (running best on Google Chrome). To open the app please use:

```r
# Launch the MLstudio
runML()
```

### **Data**

The ML Studio provide the user with the ability to load (or remove), modify, visualize and analyze multiple dataset at the same time.

Under the “Data” tab there are two sub-tabs:

1.	**Load** – set of tools to load data into the platform (from R environment, R datasets and/or csv file)

2.	**Prep** – data prep tools:

- Variables summary
- Ability to modify the variables attributes 
- dplyr data summary


#### **Loading Data**
There are three methods to load dataset into the platform:

1.	Loading dataset from the R environment, currently supporting data frame, data table, and matrix and ts objects.

2.	Loading the available dataset within installed packages, supporting data frame, data table, and matrix and ts objects.

3.	Loading from csv file.

#### **Data Attribution**

The variables attribution can be seen in the “Prep” tab in the middle table, a more in depth summary available on the variable summary box. Using the variable attributes option, it is possible to modify if needed the variables attributes. Below can be find an interactive table, the fields can be sort and a search option is available.

### **Data Summary**

A data summary function is available on the “Prep” tab under the “Select Option” dropdown menu. This is a dplyr based function and it is provide the ability to summaries data by a specific group. Currently there summaries categories are – count, mean, sd, max and mean.

### **Visualization**

Utilizing Plotly interactive data visualization tools along with Shiny engine, the ML Studio provides the user with effective tool for data exploration. The "Visualization" tab provides key functionality:

- Application for multivariate visualization – scatter, line, boxplot histogram, density, and correlation plots

- Application for time series visualization - seasonality, boxplot and lags plots
